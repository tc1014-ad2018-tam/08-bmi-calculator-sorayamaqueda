/*
 * This program is to help the user calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The BMI is obtained by dividing the Weight of
 * a person (measured in kilograms) by its Height (measured in meters) to the square.
 * For this program, the user must able to introduce such values in any possible measure unit (pounds, feet, inches) and
 * still get back their BMI. Finally tell the user will know where within the BMI classification, according to the WHO,
 * does hers or his BMI fits in.
 *
 * According to the World Health Organization, according to your BMI you will find yourself in:
 *  -UNDERWEIGHT if BMI<18.50
 *  -NORMAL RANGE if BMI=18.50 && BMI<24.99
 *  -OVERWEIGHT if BMI>=25.00
 *  -OBESE if BMI>=30.00
 *
 * The equivalences are:
 *  - 1 feet = 0.3048 meters
 *  - 1 inch = 0.0245 meters
 *  - 1 pound = 0.453 kilograms
 *
 * Problem Analysis.
 * Problem: Calculate the BMI of the user regardless of the measurement unit that they use.
 *
 * Input: User's height, user's weight.
 *
 * Process/Calculations: Convert the units if there are not in kilograms and meters. Then divide the weight by the
 * height elevated to the square. Determine in which category the user falls in.
 *
 * Output: User's BMI and category it fits.
